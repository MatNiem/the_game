# The Game
A game project I've made to pass an Object-oriented programming class

## Quick description
It's an easy card game connected with rolling dice.
I have implemented 3 levels each one is a bit harder and the last one is a boss level.
I've tried to make expanding the game as easy as possible and what I mean by that is adding new levels, characters and playable cards.
